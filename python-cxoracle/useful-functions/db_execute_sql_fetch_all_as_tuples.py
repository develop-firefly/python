# Method to execute a sql query or a query stored in a variable & fetch all results

        # It's advisable to leave the 'prefetchrows' attribute to its default value of 2 and only adjust arraysize
        # I have kept the arraysize = 500 (same as in sql developer config), but this number should change
        # based on what kind of production load are we dealing with
