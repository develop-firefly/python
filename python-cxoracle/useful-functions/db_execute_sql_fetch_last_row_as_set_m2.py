        If you are fetching a fixed number of rows, start your tuning by setting arraysize to the number of expected 
        rows, and set prefetchrows to one greater than this value. (Adding one removes the need for a round-trip to 
        check for end-of-fetch)

        Special Note:Cursor.rowfactory The rowfactory attribute of the Cursor object defines the method that will be
          called when retrieving the record. This attribute produces tuples by default. By overwriting this movement,
           it is possible to change the format of the record to another form.

        Special Note:  Cursor.scroll(value=0, mode='relative')
        Scroll the cursor in the result set to a new position according to the mode.
        If mode is “relative” (the default value), the value is taken as an offset to the current position in the 
        result set. If set to “absolute”, value states an absolute target position. If set to “first”, the cursor 
        is positioned at the first row and if set to “last”, the cursor is set to the last row in the result set.

        An error is raised if the mode is “relative” or “absolute” and the scroll operation would position the 
        cursor outside of the result set.
